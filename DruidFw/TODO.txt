1. [SPI][EPD] Is it possible to check status bit before sending byte to EPD.
   When we sending some bytes to EPD, will can use tranfer delay for preparing next byte.
   No need to wait transfer complete if we have something to do.
   a. send 1st byte
   b. prepare 2nd byte while 1st is in transfer process.
   c. send 2nd byte
   d. prepare 3rd byte while 2nd is in transfer process...

2. [LOG] log("abc"); place const string of such logs in PROGMEM. Something like this.
   #define log(X) {      \
   const char* msg PROGMEM = X;  \
   USART0_Transfer(msg); }

3. [KBD] Return "key pressed" only when key state changed from "pressed" to "released".

4. [KBD] Add capacitors to keayboard

5. [KBD] Read KBD from ISR (no need special thread). It also needed for sleep mode.
   Enable "Slew-rate control" for output

6. [EPD] Try to remove divider in EPD SPI config to increase speed

7. [HW] Add: some leds for notifications: incoming call, calendar notifications

8. [HW] Add:
        - SIM holder for micro SIM
        - microSD card slot
        - + 7 buttons (o, *, #, <, >, up, down)
        - power tumbler(s)
        - RTC (maybe it exists in XMega)
        - external RAM
        - external flash memory (program mem) is it possible
        - buttary charger
        - test points

9. [HW] 4 layer at least. external layers are only for contact pads and test points.
        Two interlan layers are for lines.

10. [HW] [KBD] Add resistors to graund

11. [HW] Hols for mounting

12. [HW] Druid logo

13. [HW] Holl for antenna soldering

14. [HW] Use GSm module with FM radio if it can work with user diaposon

15. [HW] Vibro

16. [HW] Button for screen refresh

17. [HW] Button for Telephone application start

18. [GSM] Use rtr/rts,dtr,cts to control usart queue
