1. [SPI][EPD] Is it possible to check status bit before sending byte to EPD.
   When we sending some bytes to EPD, will can use tranfer delay for preparing next byte.
   No need to wait transfer complete if we have something to do.
   a. send 1st byte
   b. prepare 2nd byte while 1st is in transfer process.
   c. send 2nd byte
   d. prepare 3rd byte while 2nd is in transfer process...

2. [LOG] log("abc"); place const string of such logs in PROGMEM. Something like this.
   #define log(X) {      \
   const char* msg PROGMEM = X;  \
   USART0_Transfer(msg); }
